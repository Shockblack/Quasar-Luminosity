# Quasar Luminosity
Astronomy 3350 Final Project: Quasar Luminosity

Made in collaboration with Kevin Hoy, Rachel Slaybaugh, Simon Filbert, and Sebastion Nunez-Ceardi

This notebook calculates the rest spectral flux density and spectral energy distributions (SED) of quasars from multiple surveys.
Surveys where data has been acquired from are Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and are stored in the included data file qsodata.dat (provided by Dr. Terndrup).
This notebook has heavy dependencies on a python packages <b>numpy</b>, <b>pandas</b>, and <b>matplotlib.pyplot</b> to handle data, compute values and plot figures.

## Key Figures
Provided below are some of the main figures resulting from this study.
See the notebook for explanations of the figures and how they were calculated.
